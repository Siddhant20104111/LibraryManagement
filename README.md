# LibraryManagement
This project is a backend for a Library Management System built with Java Spring Boot. It includes RESTful APIs for managing books, users, and transactions like borrowing and returning. It demonstrates backend development and database integration best practices.


# Library Management System Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Library Management System, developed as a practice project. 

## What is this for?

This project is designed to manage the operations of a library, including:
- Adding, removing, and updating books.
- Managing user accounts.
- Handling transactions like borrowing and returning books.
- Providing APIs for client-side or frontend integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Spring Boot**: For building the backend RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: MySQL (or specify your database).
- **Build Tool**: Maven (or Gradle if applicable).
- Any other tools or libraries you're using.

## Features
- RESTful API design for ease of integration.
- Scalable and maintainable backend architecture.
- CRUD operations for books, users, and transactions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddhant20104111/LibraryManagement.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd LibraryManagement
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the provided `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` in the **root directory**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your database credentials:
```ini
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
```

⚠️ **Note:** Ensure your database server is running. The database (`your_database_name`) will be created automatically if it doesn’t exist.

### 4. Configure Spring Boot properties:
Review `application.properties.example` to understand how Spring Boot reads from environment variables. Spring uses values like `${DB_URL}`, which will be loaded from the `.env` file at runtime.

### 5. Run the application:
Start the Spring Boot app using your IDE or command line:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
